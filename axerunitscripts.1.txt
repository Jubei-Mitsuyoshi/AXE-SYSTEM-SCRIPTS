rc.conf(5)
==========

NAME[[N]]
---------
rc.conf - Initscripts main configuration file

DESCRIPTION[[D]]
----------------
The 'rc.conf' file is the system configuration file for *initscripts*.
The format is *Bash*. It contains several commonly-edited settings such
as timezone; keymap; kernel modules; daemons to load at start-up; etc. It is
split up in a few sections to categorize configuration settings: localization,
system time, virtual consoles, hardware and misc.

Note: if the value of variable is empty (null), the feature it configures is left untouched.

LOCALIZATION[[L]]
-----------------
*LANG=*'string'

*LC_CTYPE=*'string'

*LC_COLLATE=*'string'

*LC_TIME=*'string'

*LC_NUMERIC=*'string'

*LC_MONETARY=*'string'

*LC_MESSAGES=*'string'

*LC_ALL=*'string'

This variables set your system language, which will be used by all i18n-friendly applications and utilities.
For more info *locale*(1)

Default: *empty*

SYSTEM TIME[[S]]
----------------
*TIME_ZONE=*'string'

Specifies the timezone. The setting takes effect on boot by ensuring that '/etc/localtime' is a symlink
to the correct zoneinfo file. Possible time zones are the relative path to a zoneinfo file starting
from the directory '/usr/share/zoneinfo'. For example, a German time zones would be 'Europe/Berlin',
which refers to the file '/usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin'.

Default: *empty*

*HARDWARE_CLOCK=*'utc'|'localtime'

How to interpret/update the hardware clock. (used by 'hwclock' daemon)

Options:

	- 'utc': most robust, allows operating systems to abstract local time and ease DST.
	- 'localtime': apply timezone (and DST) in hardware clock: discouraged.
	  Choose this if you dualboot with an OS which cannot handle UTC BIOS times correctly, like Windows.
      Note that recent Windows versions can use UTC, which is preferable.
	- any other value will result in the hardware clock being left untouched (useful for virtualization)

Default: *empty*

VIRTUAL CONSOLES[[V]]
---------------------
*CONSOLE_FONT=*'string'

Defines the console font to load with the *setfont* program on boot.
Possible fonts are found in '/usr/share/kbd/consolefonts' (only needed for non-US).

Default: *empty*

*CONSOLE_MAP=*'string'

Defines the console map to load with the *setfont* program on boot. Possible maps are found in
'/usr/share/kbd/consoletrans'. Set this to a map suitable for the appropriate locale (8859-1 for Latin1,
for example) if you're using an UTF-8 locale and use programs that generate 8-bit output.

Default: *empty*

*KEYMAP=*'string'

Defines the keymap to load with the *loadkeys* program on boot. Possible keymaps are
found in '/usr/share/kbd/keymaps'. 

Default: *empty*

Note: This settings are only valid for your TTYs, not any graphical *Window Managers* or *X11*/*Xorg*. If you're
using *X11* for everyday work, don't bother, as it only affects the output of Linux Console applications.

HARDWARE[[H]]
-------------
*MODULES=(*'array'*)*

Modules to load at boot-up. Blacklisted modules are not loaded.

Default: *empty*

*USE_SWAP=*'yes'|'no'

Enable swap partitions activation

Default: *no*

*USE_DMRAID=*'yes'|'no'

Scan for FakeRAID (dmraid) Volumes at start-up.

Default: *no*

*USE_BTRFS=*'yes'|'no'

Scan for BTRFS volumes at start-up.

Default: *no*

*USE_LVM=*'yes'|'no'

Scan for LVM volume groups at start-up. This is required if you use LVM.

Default: *no*

MISC[[M]]
---------
*USE_COLOR=*'yes'|'no'

Use ANSI color sequences in start-up messages

Default: *yes*

*HOSTNAME=*'string'

Hostname of machine.

Default: *empty*

*DAEMONS=(*'array'*)*

Daemons to be started at start-up.

If you are sure nothing else touches your hardware clock (such as ntpd or
by dual-booting), you might want to enable 'hwclock'. Note that this will only
make a difference if the *hwclock* program has been calibrated correctly.

If you use a network filesystem, you should enable 'netfs'.

Default: *syslog-ng crond*
